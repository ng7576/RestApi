# RestApi
This is a barebones REST api made by using SpringBoot. Its beginner friendly.
This is a basis for a bigger API that i am currently working on. 
The completed version will also be in GitHub under different repo.
I am not a Java Programmer per say, so I made this repo to i have a reference on how to structure Spring Boot API.
